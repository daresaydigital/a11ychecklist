## Description

All users don’t have the possibility to turn their device. Some users have to choose a mode (either portrait or landscape) and always have it in that mode, for example a wheelchair user that mount their mobile devices in a specific orientation.  

This requirement also implies that all content and functionality shall be available in all orientations.

## What to do

Make sure all content is presented regardless of screen orientation.

## Example

Design

![A vertical and a horizontal screen](https://github.com/daresaydigital/a11ychecklist/blob/orientation-guidelines/static/img/orientation.png?raw=true)

## Exceptions

When the orientation of the device is absolutely necessary. For example a music app using an on-screen piano that needs landscape orientation to provide large enough tap areas for the piano keys.
