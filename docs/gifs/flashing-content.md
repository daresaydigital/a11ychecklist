### Description

Flashing content can trigger seizures and must be avoided.

Any content is considered flashing if it switches from dark to light more than three times within a second and covers an area that’s more than 10 degrees of the visual field (translated into an area of 341 x 256 px on a monitor with 1024 x 768 px resolution at a typical viewing distance).

Examples:

- Video clip from a disco with flashing lights
- Animated image of series of strobe flashes
- Close ups of rapid-fire explosions.
- Gifs
