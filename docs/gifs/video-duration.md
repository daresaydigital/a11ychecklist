### Description

Content that moves or blinks, like video and gifs, can cause problems for people with reading difficulties, people with low vision, people using screen-readers, and be distracting for people with attention deficit disorders.

The recommendation is to avoid moving, blinking, scrolling content if possible, but if used and if it lasts for more than five seconds, then there must be a mechanism for users to stop it. Could be an interactive control like a pause/restart button or with keyboard shortcuts like Escape key.

Examples:

- Background video
- Background animation
- Step-by-step animations

### Exceptions

If the video/animation/gif is the only thing shown on the page, then it does not need any mechanism for pause/stop/hide, it’s only needed when the video/animation/gif is shown in parallell with other content.

### Additional Information

Make sure that any blinking content isn’t actually flashing. See [guideline about flashing content](flashing-content).
