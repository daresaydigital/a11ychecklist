<!--
A gif is considered flashing if it switches from dark to light more than three times within a second and covers an area that’s more than 10 degrees of the visual field (translated into an area of 341 x 256 px on a monitor with 1024 x 768 px resolution at a typical viewing distance).

<CategoryItem id="video-duration">

[Any video, animation or gif that starts playing automatically for more than five seconds needs to be possible to pause, stop or hide](video-duration).
