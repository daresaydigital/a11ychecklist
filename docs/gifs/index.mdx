## Gifs

Take care to ensure that the gifs on your web page have the relevant controls and behaviors.

<CategoryItem id="flashing-gif-content">

[Make sure that gif content isn't flashing more than 3 times within any one-second period](flashing-gif-content.md).

A gif is considered flashing if it switches from dark to light more than three times within a second and covers an area that’s more than 10 degrees of the visual field (translated into an area of 341 x 256 px on a monitor with 1024 x 768 px resolution at a typical viewing distance). 

</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="gif-duration">

[Make sure that gifs are not played for longer than 5 seconds](gif-duration.md).

Content that moves or blinks can cause problems for people with low vision and be distracting for people with attention deficit disorders.
