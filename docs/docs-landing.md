    <h1>Accessbility checklist</h1>
    Accessibility (a11y) is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. It's also about treating everyone the same, giving everyone equal opportunity, no matter ability or circumstances.

        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        This is a checklist that summarises all the accessibility requirements that's been stated in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>, but in a more graspable, easier way.
