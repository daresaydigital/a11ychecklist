### Description

Use elements according to their meaning, not because of the way they appear visually. By using the semantic appropriate elements blind/low-vision people using screen readers will have an easier time understanding how to navigate and use the UI. 

### Example

Use h1, h2, etc for headings. Use labels for input fields. Group related controls in forms. Use tables for tabular data. Avoid emulating links and buttons by using div, span etc. Emphasize text correctly. Etc
Use native semantic markup and complement with ARIA when standard is insufficent.
