## Programming

There are many things to consider in order to make your code accessible. 

</Card>

<CategoryItem id="semantic-markup">

[Use the right semantic markup for the different elements that are used](semantic-markup.md).

Use elements according to their meaning, not because of the way they appear visually.

</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="structure-and-presentation">

[Separate structure and presentation programmatically](structure-and-presentation.md).

Structural features in HTML, presentational features in CSS.

</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="unsupported-features">

[Donâ€™t use features that are not supported in the HTML specification](unsupported-features.md).

Itâ€™s important not to use new, unsupported features since assistive technology might not have support for it, making it impossible to use.

</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="accurate-markup">

[Make sure that all HTML validates according to chosen doctype](accurate-markup.md).

Itâ€™s important that the markup is accurate so that assistive technologies can interpret and parse the content, which rely on the markup in DOM.

</CategoryItem>
