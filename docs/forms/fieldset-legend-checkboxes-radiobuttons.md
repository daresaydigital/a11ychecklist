### Description

If a set of checkboxes and radiobuttons submit to the same named field, it's important to semantically group them together so they become treated as a single control. The individual label associated with each radiobutton or checkbox may not fully convey the group's descriptive context.

### Exception

- When a group of related radiobuttons or checkboxes includes clear instructions and distinct selections (i.e. where the individual label associated with each particular control provides a sufficient description), then the use of the fieldset and legend elements is not required.

For those occasions where fieldset-legend is not an option, then consider grouping the controls in a div with role="group" together with aria-labeledby. For radiobuttons, use role="radiogroup".

### Additional Information

Avoid nesting fieldsets unnecessarily, as this can lead to confusion.
