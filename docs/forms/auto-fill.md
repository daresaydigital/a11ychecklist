### Description

By adding what purpose different controls have, information about the user (name, address, phone number, etc) can be automatically filled in by auto-fill in browser or additional helpful elements can be added automatically to make it easier for users to understand the purpose of the field (like a phone icon for a phone number field). 

This makes it easier for people with motor impairment or cognitive disabilities to fill in forms.

Pre-defined purposes that can be used: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes
