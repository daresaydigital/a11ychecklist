### Description

Make sure that the accessible name for the control will be associated with the label and not the hint text - use aria-describedby to associate the hint text with the control. 

Note. You can check out each controls accessible name in the browser. In Chrome: Inspect element, then under “Accessibility” the name is shown under “Computed properties”.
