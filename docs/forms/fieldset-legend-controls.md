### Description

A group of controls that are logically related, like for instance controls for entering a users's adress, can be grouped with fieldset-legend. 

For those occasions where fieldset-legend is not an option, then consider grouping the controls in a div with role=""group"" together with aria-labeledby.

### Additional Information

Avoid nesting fieldsets unnecessarily, as this can lead to confusion.
