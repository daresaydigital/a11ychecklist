### Description

A test description of the error must be provided. It's not sufficient simply indicate that a field has an error by putting an asterisk on its label or turning the label red.  

It is okay to use other means, such as making the input field red, add an icon, but that can not be the only way.

The current recommendation at Daresay is to add a text + icon close to the field in which the error occured.
