### Description

The current recommendation at Daresay is to include the text ""Optional"" at the end of the label to non-mandatory fields. 

Make sure not to use only color to distinguish between mandatory and optional fields since it must be possible for people with limited color vision and color blindness to distinguish between them, as well as people using screen readers and monochrome displays.
