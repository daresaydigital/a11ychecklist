## Description

When the appearance of text conveys meaning, make sure to use the appropriate semantic markup so screen readers and other assistive technology will pronounce the words correct.

## Examples

- Use em and strong instead of using italics and bold text to highlight important text.
- Use blockquote to mark quotations.
- Use cite for citation or reference to other sources.
- Others: q. sup. sub. abbr. code, etc.
