### Description

This includes all meaningful text in the UI; text in buttons, links, placeholder text in input fields, images of text, texts that are parts of a diagram, chart, graphs, etc. It also includes different states that text can be part of, like hover, focus, highlighted/selected text.

If the background isn't uniform in color (has a pattern, gradient or is an image), make sure the contrast meets the requirement against the ""worst combination"" or use a backplate, shadow, outline, etc to secure enough contrast.

### Exceptions

1. Logotypes, brand names, text part of an inactive control, decorative text, text part of a photograph (like a street sign) does not need to fulfill the contrast requirement.
