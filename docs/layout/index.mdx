## Layout

Adapting your layout to multiple devices and sizes, as well as having easily identifiable content with a clear hierarchy is essential in helping users navigate your web page.

</Card>

<CategoryItem id="responsiveness">

[Make the design responsive so it can be displayed down to a width of 320 CSS pixels without horizontal scrolling](responsiveness.md).
<!--
Make sure that content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without the need of scrolling in two dimensions, i.e. that the content reflows so it's presented in one column. Being forced to scroll in reading direction significantly reduces reading comprehension. 
-->
</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="orientation">

[Don't restrict the UI to a specific orientation (portrait/landscape)](orientation.md).
<!--
Certain users, like wheelchair users, mount their mobile devices in a specific orientation.
This requirement also implies that all content and functionality shall be available in all orientations.
-->
</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="regions">

[Use regions/landmarks to identify sections of a page](regions.md).
<!--
Help users with assistive technology to orient and navigate more easily to different sections of a page. Landmarks should supplement native semantic markup such as headings, lists etc. Make sure all content on the page is included in landmarks.
-->
</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="whitespace">

[Don't use whitespace characters for layout purposes](whitespace.md).
<!--
You should change the styling properties instead of using whitespace characters for layout purposes. Whitespace characters can cause a lot of trouble for screen readers as they can change the meaning of the word or how it is pronounced.
-->
</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="meaningful-sequence">

[Make sure the content appear in a same meaningful sequence visually and in the source file](meaningful-sequence.md).
<!--
Turn off style sheets and make sure the content is presented in the same order as it is visually. This is to ensure that the order also makes sense for people using a screen reader and that the keyboard focus moves in a predictable way for the people who are tabbing through the UI. 
-->
</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="repeated-component-occurance">

[Ensure that repeated components, like navigation, search etc, occur in the same relative order on each page](repeated-components.md).
<!--
Use the correct HTML-elements for tables instead of changing the layout. Change the styling properties instead of using tables for layout purposes.
-->
</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="nested-headings">

[Organize pages using properly nested HTML headings](nested-headings.md).
<!--
Provide hierarchically logical heading markup for the content (h1, h2, h3 etc). By using headings in a proper way, people using assistive technology like screen readers can easily jump to a specific section of the page.
