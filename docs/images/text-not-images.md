### Description

This is important so people can adjust the representation of the text to fit their needs (change font size, foreground/background color, font family, line spacing, etc). 

### Exceptions

1) When a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed like type samples, logotypes, branding, etc. 
2) When the author doesn't have the right to redistribute. 
3) Graphs, diagrams and screenshots that visually convey important info through more than just text.

Note. Also okay to use text in image if the text still can be customized by the user (can be possible in vector formats).
