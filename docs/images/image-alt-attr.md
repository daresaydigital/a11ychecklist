## Description

Alt attributes (alt text) give a description of an image for people who may not be able to view them. When an alt attribute isn't present on an image, a screen reader may announce the image's file name and path instead, failing to communicate the image’s content.

Note. Images implemented as CSS backgrounds will not be visible to screen readers.
Note. Can also use aria-label.
