### Description

Not every graphical object needs to have contrast with its surroundings, only those parts that are required for a user to understand what the graphic is conveying. Identify them and ensure that there's enough contrast.

### Examples

- For simple graphics such as single-color icons the entire image is a graphical object and need to fulfil the requirement. 
- For more complex graphics it's every line and shape of the image that is needed to make sense of what it's visualing, like the different lines in a graph.

### Exceptions

1. Graphics that are only used for aesthetic purposes.
2. If the information in the image is available in another form, like in a Long description.
3. Graphics is part of a logo or brand name.
4. Flags.
5. Pictures of real life scenes such as photos of people or scenery.
6. Images/screenshots representing other things, like a screenshot of how a website use to look like.
