## Images

Graphics and images are a great tool to convey emotion and information - so make sure that everyone can access it!

</Card>

<CategoryItem id="additional-cues-info-color">

[If color is used to convey information within non-text content like charts, infographics, diagrams, etc, additional cues like patterns or directly applied labels must be available](additional-cues-info-color.md).
<!--
Color can't be the only way to differentiate between different elements within a charts, infographics, diagrams, maps, etc. A non-color difference needs to be applied so people with low color vision or colorblindness can distinguish between the different elements.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="alt-text-color-images">

[Make sure that images that convey information with use of different colors includes that information in the text alternative](alt-text-color-images.md).
<!--
An SVG image of a chemical compound, where identification of that compound is done based on the colors used in the image. The text alternative (alt text, long description, nearby text) need to include the same information so that people who can't percieve color gets the same information.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="combine-text-image-link">

[Make sure that image and text link that goes to the same destination is combined into a single link, rather than creating separate links for each element](combine-text-image-link.md).
<!--
Having everything clickable is good for touch areas but don't repeat the link for every element since screen readers will read them one by one.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="complex-image-descriptions">

[Make sure that complex images, like infographics, charts, diagrams, graphs and maps, have (except for an alt attribute) a long description in nearby text](complex-image-descriptions.md).
<!--
If the image is described in adjacent text, write in alt text under which section the information can be found. 
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="decorative-images-empty-alt">

[Make sure that decorative images have empty alt attribute value](decorative-images-empty-alt.md).
<!--
Decorative images do not communicate information that is required to understand the website's content. Images can be deemed decorative if the information is already described in adjacent text or the images is added to make the site more visually attractive.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="grouping-related-images">

[Make sure that a collection of related images are grouped together in an appropriate way](grouping-related-images.md).
<!--
or a group of similiar image objects, like stars that are showing rating only the first star should include the alt text and the other stars should have an empty alt (alt="") to avoid unnecessary duplication. 
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="image-alt-attr">

[Make sure that images that communicates information/meaning have an alt attribute](image-alt-attr.md).
<!--
Alt attributes (alt text) give a description of an image for people who may not be able to view them. When an alt attribute isn't present on an image, a screen reader may announce the image's file name and path instead, failing to communicate the imageâ€™s content.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="image-link-alt-text">

[When an image is the only content of a link, the text alternative for the image should convey action](image-link-alt-text.md).
<!--
For example, search button that only holds a magnifying lens should have an alt text that states "Search", not "Magnifying glass". A printer icon should state "Print this page" instead "image of printer". A clickable logo should state where you end up, e.g. "Daresay home" or "Daresay homepage".
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="image-text-alt-description">

[For images containing text, make sure the alt description includes the image's text](image-text-alt-description.md).
<!--
You should not use text as image. For those cases it can not be avoided, like for instance in a non-clickable logo the alt text should state what the logo says, e.g. "Daresay".
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="image-width-viewport">

[Adjust the width of the image appropriately to different viewport and zoom levels](image-width-viewport.md).
<!--
Make sure that the whole image is presented without the need of horistonal scrolling (at a width equally to 320 CSS pixels).
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="interactive-image-maps">

[For interactive image maps make sure both the image and the different area elements has text alternatives](interactive-image-maps.md).
<!--
See: https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/imagemap/
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="text-not-images">

[Use text rather than images of text](text-not-images.md).
<!--
his is important so people can adjust the representation of the text to fit their needs (change font size, foreground/background color, font family, line spacing, etc).
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="text-on-image-contrast">

[For images containing text, make sure that the text fulfill the contrast requirement for normal-sized and large-sized text against the background ](text-on-image-contrast.md).
<!--
This also includes text that are part of charts, infographics, diagrams, maps, etc.
