## Description

Turn off style sheets and make sure the content is presented in the same order as it is visually. This is to ensure that the order also makes sense for people using a screen reader and that the keyboard focus moves in a predictable way for the people who are tabbing through the UI.  

Make sure you aren't duplicating elements/sections.

## Additional infromation

There is another requirement (2.4.3) that specifically targets components and tab order (found under Navigation).
