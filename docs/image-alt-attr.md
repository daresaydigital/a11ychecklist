## Description

Alt attributes (alt text) give a description of an image for people who may not be able to view them. When an alt attribute isn't present on an image, a screen reader may announce the image's file name and path instead, failing to communicate the imageâ€™s content.

Note. Images implemented as CSS backgrounds will not be visible to screen readers.
Note. Can also use aria-label.
