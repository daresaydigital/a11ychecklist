## Description

Flashing content can trigger seizures and must be avoided. 

A gif is considered flashing if it switches from dark to light more than three times within a second and covers an area that’s more than 10 degrees of the visual field (translated into an area of 341 x 256 px on a monitor with 1024 x 768 px resolution at a typical viewing distance).
