## Description

For a group of similiar image objects, like stars that are showing rating only the first star should include the alt text and the other stars should have an empty alt (alt="") to avoid unnecessary duplication. 

For images that are a collection of related images they should be grouped together and given an overall caption as well as individual ones.
