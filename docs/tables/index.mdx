## Tables

Structure and label your tables so that their data is readable by everyone.

</Card>

<CategoryItem id="data-cells-several-headers">

[Use id if the data cell is associated with several headers.](data-cells-several-headers.md).
<!--
This technique (id/headers) is used when data cells are associated with more than one row and/or one column header.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="scope-tables">

[Use scope for complex tables](scope-tables.md).
<!--
Associate header cells with data cells in complex tables using the scope attribute. Choose the appropriate value - row, col, rowgroup, or colgroup.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="summary-tables">

[Use summary for complex tables](summary-tables.md).
<!--
Use the summary attribute to give a brief explanation of how the data has been organized or how to navigate the table for people using screen readers.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="table-title-caption">

[Use caption when the table has a title/heading](table-title-caption.md).
<!--
Caption ensures that the title/heading gets associated with the table. Screen readers can navigate directly to a table caption if it's available.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="table-data-relation">

[Make it possible to percieve the relationship in data table by using correct table markup](table-data-relation.md).
<!--
Use table headers appropriately (data cells are associated with their headers).
-->
</CategoryItem>
