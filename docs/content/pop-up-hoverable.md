### Description

It must be possible for users to move their mouse pointer over the pop-up content (i.e. away from the control that triggered the pop-up ) without it disappearing. This is so that all users have the possibility to read the pop-up content that can be only partly visible due to a magnified view or having a large mouse pointer that covers the content of the pop-up. 

I.e. this means that the pop-up content need to be in close proximity to the control triggering it.

### Examples

Examples of pop-up content: custom tooltips, sub-menus (drop down menus), nonmodal popovers.

### Exceptions

1. Modal dialogues 
2. Pop-up content styled by the browser such as built-in tooltips.
