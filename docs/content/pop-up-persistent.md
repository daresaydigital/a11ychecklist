### Description

The content of the pop-up must remain visible until: 
1) User removes hover or focus from the trigger or the pop-up content.
2) User dismisses the pop-up content via a close mechanism like the Escape key.
3) The information in the pop-up content is no longer valid, such as a busy message that is no longer valid. 

This is so that user will have enough time to take in/read the pop-up content.

### Examples

Examples of pop-up content: custom tooltips, sub-menus (drop down menus), nonmodal popovers.

### Exceptions

1. Modal dialogues 
2. Pop-up content styled by the browser such as built-in tooltips.
