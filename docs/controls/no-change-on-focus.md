### Description

When a control receives focus it shall not result in a substantial change that disorients the users. All changes of context would be triggered only by a specific action on the part of the user.

### Examples

- A form thatâ€™s automatically submitted when the submit button receives focus.
- A new window is launched when a link receives focus. 
- Focus gets automatically moved to another control.

### Additional Information

Showing additional things on hover, like a tooltip or a drop down menu is okay. These things are not changing the context (moving focus away to another place).
