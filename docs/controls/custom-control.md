### Description

If custom controls are created or elements are reprogrammed to have a different role and/or function than usual, then additional measures need to be taken to ensure that the controls provide important information to assistive technologies so users understand what it is and how to interact with it.

Make sure it has an accessible name, the correct role, values, states and properties. Use the WAI-ARIA specification:
- Role: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#role_definitions
- States and properties: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#states_and_properties

### Additional Information

Standard HTML controls already meet these requirements when used according to specification.
