sidebar_label: Control release for action
---

### Description

This aims to reduce accidentally triggering things on a page, making it easier for all users for hitting the wrong control. 

### Examples

Examples of pop-up content: custom tooltips, sub-menus (drop down menus), nonmodal popovers. 

### Exceptions

1. When it’s essential that the action takes place on the down-event, like playing an on-screen piano keyboard or emulating a keyboard or numeric keypad.
2. When the up-event reverses the outcome of the down-event, like when a pop-up is shown on the down-event and disappears with the up-event.
