### Description

All of the dialogue and important sounds should be embedded as text (captions) in the video track.

The audio (spoken) version that is provided should present the same information that is provided visually (in addition to the normal audio in the video). Could either be solved with two versions of the movie or two different soundtracks. [Example of audio description](https://www.digitala11y.com/understanding-sc-1-2-5-audio-description-prerecorded/)

### Additional information

1.2.3 A states that you can decide if you want to make an audio description or a text alternative, but to fulfill 1.2.5 AA you need to make an audio description."

Captions include more information than regular subtitles like identifying who is speacking and notate sound effects. Closed captions are recommended.
