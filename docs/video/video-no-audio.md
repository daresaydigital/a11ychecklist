### Description

Essential information expressed in video can be visualized in a variety of ways through animation, text, graphics, the setting, the background, actions and expressions of people, animals, etc.

Example:

- Animation showing assemble of woodworking project without any sound, i.e. just showing steps.

### What to do

Present the same information that's in the video either as:

- A document. Which includes all important information as well as descriptions of scenary, actions, expressions etc (an updated screen play).
- As audio. One way of doing this is to provide an audio track describing the information in the video. The audio should be a common audio format used on the internet, such as MP3.
