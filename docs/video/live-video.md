### Description

Captions enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to watch real-time presentations.

Example:

- Live audio in combination with a presentation, like an online seminar/webbinar.
- Evening news shown online.

### Additional information

Captions include more information than regular subtitles like identifying who is speacking and notate sound effects. Closed captions are recommended."
