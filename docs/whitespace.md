## Description

You should change the styling properties instead of using whitespace characters for layout purposes. Whitespace characters can cause a lot of trouble for screen readers as they can change the meaning of the word or how it is pronounced. 

When blank characters are inserted to control letter spacing within a word, they may change the interpretation of the word or cause it not to be programmatically recognized as a single word 

## What to do

- Avoid using whitespace characters (i.e blanks/spaces and tabs etc.)

## Example

This example has white spaces within a word to space out the letters in a heading. Screen readers may read each letter individually instead of the word “Welcome”.

### Code

```html
<h1>W e l c o m e</h1>
```

&amp;nbsp; can also be used to add white space, producing similiar problems:

```html
<h1>H&nbsp; e&nbsp; l&nbsp; l&nbsp; o</h1>
```
