## Links

The links on your page should clearly communicate where they lead and what their intentions are.

</Card>

<ProgressBar />

<CategoryItem id="link-text">

[Provide a link text so that the purpose of the link can be determined by the text alone or by the link text and its context](link-text.md).
<!--
Some assistive technology can list all links on a page. Giving all links clear and meaningful texts will help these users to choose and interact with your content more easily.
-->
</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="link-styling">

[Ensure that links are recognizable with additional cues other than color](link-styling.md).
<!--
Color alone is not sufficent to indicate the presence of a link, additional cues like underline, bigger font, another font, bold, etc must be used.
-->
</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="image-text-alt-description">

[For images containing text, make sure the alt description includes the image's text](image-text-alt-description.md).
<!--
You should not use text as image. For those cases it can not be avoided, like for instance in a non-clickable logo the alt text should state what the logo says, e.g. "Daresay".
-->
</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="combine-text-image-link">

[Make sure that image and text link that goes to the same destination is combined into a single link, rather than creating separate links for each element](combine-text-image-link.md).
<!--
Having everything clickable is good for touch areas but don't repeat the link for every element since screen readers will read them one by one.
-->
