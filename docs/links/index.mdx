## Links

The links on your page should clearly communicate where they lead and what their intentions are.

</Card>

<CategoryItem id="link-text">

[Provide a link text so that the purpose of the link can be determined by the text alone or by the link text and its context](link-text.md).

Some assistive technology can list all links on a page. Giving all links clear and meaningful texts will help these users to choose and interact with your content more easily.

</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="link-styling">

[Ensure that links are recognizable with additional cues other than color](link-styling.md).

Color alone is not sufficent to indicate the presence of a link, additional cues like underline, bigger font, another font, bold, etc must be used.

</CategoryItem>

<CategoryItem id="link-element">

[Use a element for links ](link-element.md).

Avoid using div, span, etc for links.
