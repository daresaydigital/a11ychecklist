## Description

Make it easier for screen reader users and those who are tabbing through the UI to navigate your site by allowing them to skip over repeating content, such as header and navigation.

The link does not need to be visible when it does not have focus. 

## Tips

Even though it’s considered sufficient to have proper heading structure or/and regions/landsmarks to make it possible for users to skip repeating content on a page, adding a “skip” link is still recommended to best support sighted keyboard users (since navigating by headings or regions is not supported by most browsers)."
