sidebar_label: Navigation links occur in the same relative order

### Description

This will help users to predict where they will find content in the navigation. 

Note. It is okay to add/remove links in between of existing links, like a sub navigation, as long as the relative order of the existing (surrounding) links are not changed.

### Exceptions

If the user has chosen to change the order, either by using an adaptive mechanism or setting a preference.
