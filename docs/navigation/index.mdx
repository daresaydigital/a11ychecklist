<!--
This can become an issue when using plug-ins or embedded applications on the page, as well as modal dialogs, form controls as a calendar picker or autocomplete widgets. The user must be able to leave the component with standard navigation such as arrow or tab keys (or other standard exit method).

</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="componentsfocus">

[Make sure that components receives focus in a way that makes sense](components-focus.md).

[Ensure that the links belonging to navigation always occur in the same relative order on each page](nav-links-same-order.md).

Keyboard shortcuts can make it faster to navigate your content, but should be used with care. Certain users can due to motor difficulties accidentally tap the wrong key, people who uses speech input can accidentally trigger a shortcut and some users might have set their own shortcuts to make navigation easier for them which then gets mixed up.

<!--
Make it easier for screen reader users and those who are tabbing through the UI to navigate your site by allowing them to skip over repeating content, such as header and navigation.
