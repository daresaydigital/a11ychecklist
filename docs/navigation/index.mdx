<CategoryItem id="avoid-navigation-trap">

[Make sure that users donâ€™t get trapped in a particular section of the page or in a component while navigating with a keyboard](avoid-navigation-trap.md).

This can become an issue when using plug-ins or embedded applications on the page, as well as modal dialogs, form controls as a calendar picker or autocomplete widgets. The user must be able to leave the component with standard navigation such as arrow or tab keys (or other standard exit method).

</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="componentsfocus">

[Make sure that components receives focus in a way that makes sense](components-focus.md).

Itâ€™s important that the tab (keyboard focus) order is set so it matches the expected reading order so that keyboard users donâ€™t get disoriented when tabbing through the UI.

</CategoryItem>

[Group navigation links with nav](link-nav-grouping.md).

<CategoryItem id="keyboard-shortcuts">

[If you implement custom keyboard shortcuts for your content make sure they can either be turned off, remapped or are only active when a specific control has focus](keyboard-shortcuts.md).

Keyboard shortcuts can make it faster to navigate your content, but should be used with care. Certain users can due to motor difficulties accidentally tap the wrong key, people who uses speech input can accidentally trigger a shortcut and some users might have set their own shortcuts to make navigation easier for them which then gets mixed up.

</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="link-to-main-content">

[Provide a link to skip to the main content as the first focusable link on the page](keyboard-shortcuts.md).

Make it easier for screen reader users and those who are tabbing through the UI to navigate your site by allowing them to skip over repeating content, such as header and navigation.

</CategoryItem>


<CategoryItem id="more-ways-navigation">

[Provide more than one way to navigate to the different pages of the site](more-ways-navigation.md).

Itâ€™s important that there is more than one way for users to locate content in a manner that best meets their needs.
