### Description

People who are blind, who have low vision or have trouble navigating with a mouse due to tremors need to be able to navigate and use the site via keyboard only (or keyboard alternative). 

Tabb through the UI and make sure you can do everything with only the keyboard. Don't forget to give focus to any modal dialogues that are shown.

This does not mean that each individual control must be possible to use with a keyboard as long as there are multiple ways to perform the same function and one supports keyboard use. 

### Exceptions

1. When the path of the userâ€™s movement (not just endpoints) is essential to performing the task - like free hand drawing, flying a helicopter after a set course, etc.
