<CategoryItem id="single-point-actions">

[Make sure that any functionality that can be performed with complex finger movements, also is possible with simple, single-point actions](single-point-actions.md).

Complex movements and gestures where you need to use more than one finger or need to follow a path type gesture require dexterity and accuracy that may be hard for certain users.
