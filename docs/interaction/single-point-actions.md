### Description

Complex movements and gestures where you need to use more than one finger or need to follow a path type gesture require dexterity and accuracy that may be hard for certain users. Examples: swiping, dragging items, panning, pinching to zoom, swiping or tapping with multiple fingers, etc. It’s therefore important that the users can do the same thing but with simple, single-point actions such as a tap, click, double tap, double click, long press, or click & hold.

### Example
In a map where you can zoom with pinch gesture, there’s also controls (buttons) to zoom in and out.

### Exceptions

1. Functionality that is inherently and necessarily based on complex paths or multipoint gestures. For example, entering your signature may be inherently path-based.
2. Functionality that comes with the browser, like navigating within page history with horisontal swipe or scrolling the page content with vertical swipe.
